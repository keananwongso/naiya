# Frontend

Ownership: 🟦 Ven

This houses the UI/UX. The current Next.js app lives at repo root (`src/app`). Keep UI-specific docs/scripts here as the project grows.

Responsibilities:
- Onboarding UI, life dump interface, calendar rendering, drag/resize/create/delete interactions, chat input.
- Validate user input against shared schemas before sending to backend.

See ../docs/contracts.md for data contracts and responsibilities.
